		<h2>Who: Jenny Jones</h2>
		<h2>What: A domestic abuse survivor, mom, full-stack web developer, friend and Jesus follower (not necessarily in that order!)</h2>
		<h2>When: Right now, because the church needs to wake up to the realities of domestic violence and start handling it differently.</h2>
		<h2>Where: My little corner of the internet and in my own local church. (Check out <a href="http://www.gccdenver.org">Grace Community Church!</a>)</h2>
		<h2>Why: For the majority of my almost 9 year marriage I have been experiencing domestic abuse. Those 9 years have created a passion in me to share the stories and experiences of other survivors, as well as my own, in order to help empower and educate other surivors as well as their churches, friends and family.</h2>
		<h2>How: By honoring the experiences and knowledge of survivors. As women walk through the process of escaping domestic abuse we become rich and valuable resources for other women. I hope to allow other survivors to tell their stories while shareing those resources with others.</h2>
